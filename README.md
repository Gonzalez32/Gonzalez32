#### FULL-STACK ENGINEER
![Full Stack Developer](https://email.uplers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GIF-blog.gif)

I am a full-stack engineer who tries to make the most out of difficult situations. I'm not comfortable with settling and I’m always looking for opportunities to do better. I still get nervous at daily stand-up and stand-down, but I enjoy these moments because we’re all together as a team. I am excited to solve, adept at learning quickly with a driven and positive attitude. I look to find new creative ways to inspire and better the lives of others.
Ready to make a positive impact, join a great team and grow within.


Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / Ruby / Python
